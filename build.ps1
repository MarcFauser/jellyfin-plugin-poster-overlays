.SYNOPSIS
    Builds Jellyfin.Plugin.PosterOverlays and packages one installable ZIP per Jellyfin line.

.DESCRIPTION
    Publishes the plugin for every target framework, writes the meta.json that
    Jellyfin's PluginManager reads from the plugin folder, and packs both into a ZIP
    under dist\.

    net9.0  -> Jellyfin 10.11.x   (the .NET version is dictated by the server runtime)
    net10.0 -> Jellyfin 12.x      (compiles, but untested - no v12 server here yet)

    Install a ZIP by extracting it into <ProgramDataPath>/plugins/Poster Overlays_<version>/
    on the server and restarting Jellyfin. The server's ProgramDataPath is shown by
    GET /System/Info.

    -Publish additionally creates one GitHub release per built artifact and pushes the
    updated manifest.json. The order is not a convention but a constraint: a manifest
    entry whose release does not exist yet is a 404 in the user's dashboard, so the
    releases go first and the manifest only after the uploaded files have been
    downloaded again and their checksums confirmed.

    ./build.ps1
    ./build.ps1 -Target net9.0
    ./build.ps1 -Changelog 'What changed.' -Publish
